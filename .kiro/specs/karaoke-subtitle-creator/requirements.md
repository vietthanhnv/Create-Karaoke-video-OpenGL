# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Karaoke Subtitle Creator is a professional desktop application built with PyQt6 that enables users to create high-quality karaoke videos with advanced text effects and real-time preview capabilities. The software combines OpenGL-based rendering with an intuitive timeline editor to produce synchronized subtitle overlays for karaoke content.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a karaoke content creator, I want to import video files and create new projects, so that I can start working on subtitle overlays for my karaoke videos.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user selects "New Project" THEN the system SHALL display a project creation dialog with video import options
2. WHEN the user imports a video file THEN the system SHALL support MP4, MOV, AVI, and MKV formats
3. WHEN a project is created THEN the system SHALL initialize a timeline editor synchronized with the imported video
4. WHEN the user saves a project THEN the system SHALL store project data in JSON format
5. WHEN the user opens the application THEN the system SHALL display a list of recent projects for quick access

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a subtitle editor, I want to add and format text overlays on a timeline, so that I can create synchronized karaoke subtitles with precise timing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user adds text to the timeline THEN the system SHALL create a new subtitle track with editable text content
2. WHEN the user adjusts text formatting THEN the system SHALL provide font, size, color, and style controls
3. WHEN the user positions text on the timeline THEN the system SHALL allow precise timing adjustment with keyframe support
4. WHEN the user copies keyframes THEN the system SHALL enable paste functionality to duplicate timing patterns
5. IF the user imports audio THEN the system SHALL display an audio waveform for timing reference

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a karaoke designer, I want to apply visual effects to text, so that I can create engaging and professional-looking karaoke videos.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user selects text animation effects THEN the system SHALL provide fade in/out, slide transitions, typewriter, and bounce animations
2. WHEN the user applies visual effects THEN the system SHALL offer glow, outline, drop shadow, and gradient fill options
3. WHEN the user enables particle effects THEN the system SHALL render sparkle, fire, and smoke effects synchronized with text appearance
4. WHEN the user applies 3D effects THEN the system SHALL support text rotation, depth extrusion, and perspective transformation
5. WHEN the user configures color effects THEN the system SHALL provide rainbow cycling, pulse animation, and strobe effects

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want real-time preview of my karaoke video, so that I can see exactly how the final output will look while editing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user makes changes to text or effects THEN the system SHALL update the OpenGL preview in real-time at 60fps
2. WHEN the user plays the video THEN the system SHALL synchronize subtitle overlay with video playback
3. WHEN the user adjusts preview settings THEN the system SHALL provide zoom, pan, and quality preset controls
4. WHEN the user enables safe area guides THEN the system SHALL display TV-safe boundaries for proper formatting
5. IF parameter changes occur THEN the system SHALL respond with sub-100ms latency

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a video producer, I want to export my karaoke project as a high-quality video file, so that I can distribute the final karaoke content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user initiates export THEN the system SHALL support HD and 4K resolution output
2. WHEN the user selects export format THEN the system SHALL provide MP4, MOV, and AVI format options
3. WHEN the user configures export settings THEN the system SHALL offer quality presets and custom encoding parameters
4. WHEN export is in progress THEN the system SHALL display progress tracking with ETA estimation
5. WHEN batch export is selected THEN the system SHALL process multiple projects sequentially

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a professional user, I want the application to perform efficiently with hardware acceleration, so that I can work smoothly with high-resolution content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL require OpenGL 3.3+ compatible GPU
2. WHEN rendering complex effects THEN the system SHALL utilize hardware acceleration for optimal performance
3. WHEN processing 1080p content THEN the system SHALL maintain 60fps preview performance
4. WHEN exporting 4K content THEN the system SHALL leverage multi-core CPU utilization
5. IF hardware encoding is available THEN the system SHALL use it for faster export times

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a multilingual content creator, I want comprehensive text and file format support, so that I can work with diverse karaoke content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user enters text THEN the system SHALL support Unicode for multi-language subtitles
2. WHEN the user imports subtitle files THEN the system SHALL support SRT, ASS, and VTT formats
3. WHEN the user imports audio THEN the system SHALL support MP3, WAV, AAC, and FLAC formats
4. WHEN the user exports subtitles THEN the system SHALL maintain embedded styling in ASS format
5. WHEN the user adjusts text layout THEN the system SHALL provide alignment, line spacing, and character spacing controls
