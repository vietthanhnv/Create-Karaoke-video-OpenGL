# Audio Import Bug - FIXED ✅

## 🐛 Issue Identified and Resolved

### **Problem:**

The audio import was failing with the error:

```
'AudioAsset' object has no attribute 'is_valid'
```

### **Root Cause:**

In `src/ui/main_window.py`, the `_import_audio()` method was incorrectly treating the return value of `project_manager.import_audio()` as a ValidationResult object, but it actually returns an AudioAsset object.

**Incorrect Code:**

```python
result = project_manager.import_audio(file_path)
if result.is_valid:  # ❌ AudioAsset doesn't have is_valid attribute
```

**Correct Code:**

```python
audio_asset = project_manager.import_audio(file_path)
validation_result = audio_asset.validate()  # ✅ Use validate() method
if validation_result.is_valid:
```

### **Fix Applied:**

Updated `src/ui/main_window.py` lines 543-546 to use the correct validation pattern:

```python
# Before (BROKEN):
result = project_manager.import_audio(file_path)
if result.is_valid:

# After (FIXED):
audio_asset = project_manager.import_audio(file_path)
validation_result = audio_asset.validate()
if validation_result.is_valid:
```

## ✅ **Verification: All Tests Pass**
