## 🛠 Technical Implementation Details

### Font Loading and Glyph Processing

```python
# Automatic font detection and loading
manager = FontManager()
success = manager.load_default_font(48)

# Unicode glyph rendering
manager.render_text_glyphs(font_path, font_size, "Hello 世界 مرحبا")
```

### Advanced Text Rendering

```python
# High-quality text with effects
style = TextStyle(
    font_path="arial.ttf",
    font_size=48,
    color=(1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0),
    outline_width=2.0,
    outline_color=(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0),
    shadow_offset=(3.0, 3.0)
)

renderer.render_text("Karaoke Subtitle", x, y, style)
```

### SDF-Enhanced Quality

```python
# Crisp text at any scale with SDF
sdf_generator = SDFGenerator(spread=8)
sdf = sdf_generator.generate_sdf(glyph_bitmap)
# Results in smooth text scaling and enhanced effects
```

## 📊 Performance Characteristics
